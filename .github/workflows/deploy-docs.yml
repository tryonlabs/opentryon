# GitHub Pages Deployment
#
# This workflow is DISABLED - we use the gh-pages branch approach instead.
# 
# To deploy docs:
#   1. cd docs
#   2. npm run build
#   3. npm run deploy
#
# The deploy script pushes the build folder to the gh-pages branch.
# GitHub Pages is configured to serve from the gh-pages branch.
#
# Manual deployment (without npm script):
#   npx gh-pages -d build
#
# See docs/README.md for more details.
