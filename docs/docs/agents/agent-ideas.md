:::info Community-Driven Initiative
This document shares **20 AI agent ideas** for the fashion industry. We're inviting the **open-source community** to build these agents together and create a comprehensive Fashion AI Agents ecosystem. Whether you're building agents already or want to start, we welcome your contributions!
:::

## Our Vision

We envision an **open-source ecosystem of Fashion AI Agents** that works seamlessly with **OpenTryOn** (our open-source library) and integrates with **TryOn AI** (our cloud-hosted platform for fashion brands, designers, and e-commerce marketplaces). This ecosystem will:

- **Democratize Fashion AI**: Make advanced fashion technology accessible to everyone
- **Foster Innovation**: Enable developers, researchers, and fashion enthusiasts to contribute
- **Build Together**: Create a collaborative community around fashion AI agents
- **Share Knowledge**: Document best practices, patterns, and implementations
- **Integrate Seamlessly**: Design agents that work with OpenTryOn library and TryOn AI platform

:::tip Join the Movement
Are you building fashion AI agents? Have ideas for new agents? Want to contribute to open-source? **We'd love to have you!** See our [Call to Action](#call-to-action) section below.
